Title: Unifying Estimation Results with Binary Dependent Variables
Author: Arne Henningsen, Geraldine Henningsen
Maintainer: Arne Henningsen <arne.henningsen@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.14.0)
Suggests: Ecdat (>= 0.1-5)
Description: This R package provides functions for unifying estimation results 
  with binary dependent variables (e.g., for meta-analyses), 
  particularly for the case if the estimation results are obtained 
  with different models/estimators 
  (e.g., linear probability model, logit, probit, ...) 
  and/or with different transformations of the explanatory variable of interest 
  (e.g., linear, quadratic, logarithmic, interval-coded, ...).
