Description: This R package provides functions for unifying estimation results 
  with binary dependent variables (e.g., for meta-analyses), 
  particularly for the case if the estimation results are obtained 
  with different models/estimators 
  (e.g., linear probability model, logit, probit, ...) 
  and/or with different transformations of the explanatory variable of interest 
  (e.g., linear, quadratic, logarithmic, interval-coded, ...).
