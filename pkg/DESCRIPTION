Title: Unifying Estimation Results with Binary Dependent Variables
Author: Arne Henningsen, Geraldine Henningsen
Maintainer: Arne Henningsen <arne.henningsen@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.14.0)
Suggests: sampleSelection (>= 0.7-0), maxLik (>= 1.1-2), mfx (>= 1.1), 
  mlogit (>= 0.3-0), MASS (>= 7.3-50), mvProbit (>= 0.1-8)
Description: Calculate unified measures 
  that quantify the effect of a covariate on a binary dependent variable
  (e.g., for meta-analyses). 
  This can be particularly important 
  if the estimation results are obtained 
  with different models/estimators 
  (e.g., linear probability model, logit, probit, ...) 
  and/or with different transformations of the explanatory variable of interest 
  (e.g., linear, quadratic, interval-coded, ...).
  The calculated unified measures are:
  (a) semi-elasticities of linear, quadratic, or interval-coded covariates and
  (b) effects of linear, quadratic, interval-coded, or categorical covariates 
  when a linear or quadratic covariate changes between distinct intervals,
  the reference category of a categorical variable 
  or the reference interval of an interval-coded variable needs to be changed,
  or some categories of a categorical covariate 
  or some intervals of an interval-coded covariate need to be grouped together.
  Approximate standard errors of the unified measures are also calculated.
